For my second visual project, I wanted to create a much cleaner looking image. I used all the skills I learned from the first assignment to create a much better project without as much hassle. The idea behind the project is to be environmentally friendly. I got the idea from a project I worked on in an engineering class about reducing Pitt's single use plastic waste. I'm not particularly pushing global warming behind the image, but I thought it was a neat idea that at least gets people interested in helping the environment in any away.
