Baseline:
-Export image to .png
-Add at least two ethically sourced images 
-Use a tool other than the basic ones (Move, resize, etc.)
-Use arrangement, size, color, visual rhythm, and/or contrast to focus viewers' attention
-Have a clear message or intervention
-Use at least 3 layers

Aspirational:
-Use folders to group layers
-Practice using additional GIMP tools/filters that are new to you

These are rough criteria for my project that I think I can obtain.
